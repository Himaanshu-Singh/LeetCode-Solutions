3042. Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I


You are given a 0-indexed string array words
Let's define a boolean function isPrefixAndSuffix that takes two strings, str1 and str2:
isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) returns true if str1 is both a 
prefix
 and a 
suffix
 of str2, and false otherwise.
For example, isPrefixAndSuffix("aba", "ababa") is true because "aba" is a prefix of "ababa" and also a suffix, but isPrefixAndSuffix("abc", "abcd") is false.

Return an integer denoting the number of index pairs (i, j) such that i < j, and isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]) is true.



Example 2:

Input: words = ["pa","papa","ma","mama"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix("pa", "papa") is true.
i = 2 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix("ma", "mama") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 2. 


SOLUTION : 


class Solution:
    def countPrefixSuffixPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
          
                if words[j].startswith(words[i]) and words[j].endswith(words[i]):
                    count += 1

        return count
